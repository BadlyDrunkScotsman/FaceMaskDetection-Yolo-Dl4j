* download model from g-drive watch [model.txt]()
* If you own an NVIDIA card with a CUDA support you can enable the usage in Gradle file

###Training
* If you wish to use your own data simply paste it into the /data folder, link for an example set is in [data.txt]()
* The project is using a Keras Yolo data-format
